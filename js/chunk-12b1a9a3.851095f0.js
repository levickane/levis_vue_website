The man obeyed. He stooped down and picked up a handful of pebbles and put them in his pocket. The next day he reached into his pocket and found diamonds and rubies and emeralds.

After losing my leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009, I had finally found my way in my newly amputated life in 2012, when I was introduced to the sport of ParaTriathlon. Here, I would be racing against other athletes with the same level of disability as myself (above-knee amputee). In the year 2015 I had hit my personal peak with athletics getting a Gold medal at National championships, Silver medal at World Championships, a Bronze medal at Continental Championships and I became the first single-leg above-knee amputee to ever run a sub 20:00 5k in the entire World. After that, I ran my own fitness training and coaching business for 5 years. Using my education in Kinesiology, paired with my story of inspiration, my business flourished!",bio3:"But then sadly, due to Covid-19, my business was brought to a screeching hault.

After just 1 month of fully immersing myself in something that I originally knew nothing about, I came to realize that I had finally found the pebbles that I've been longing for.
